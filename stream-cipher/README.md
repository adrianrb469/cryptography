# Stream Cipher Implementation

This project demonstrates a simple stream cipher implementation using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) for educational purposes.

## Overview

The notebook implements:

- A pseudorandom keystream generator using LCG
- Encryption and decryption functions using XOR operations
- Test cases demonstrating the cipher's functionality
- Analysis of security considerations

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install jupyter pandas`
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open `exercise.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially

## Security Notice

This implementation is for educational purposes only. The LCG algorithm is not cryptographically secure and should not be used for sensitive data encryption in production environments.
