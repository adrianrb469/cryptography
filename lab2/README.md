# Lab 2: Binary Operations & Image Processing

## Part A: Binary Operations

A command-line tool that provides various binary operations:

- Text to Binary conversion
- Binary to Text conversion
- Text to Base64 encoding
- Base64 to Text decoding
- XOR operation

Run the program and select option 6 from the menu to see examples of each operation.

## Part B: Image Processing

Contains two image processing scripts:

1. `b_1.py`: Decrypts an encrypted image using XOR with a given key
2. `b_2.py`: Performs XOR operations between two images (original and key image)

The scripts demonstrate image encryption/decryption using the XOR operation with both binary keys and key images.
